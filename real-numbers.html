  <h1>Chapter 1 – Real Numbers (Class 10 CBSE 2025–26)</h1>
  <h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
  <p>Real numbers are numbers that can be represented on the number line. These include both rational and irrational numbers.</p>
  <h2>1.2 Euclid’s Division Lemma (Repeated)</h2>
  <p>For any two positive integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r such that: a = bq + r where 0 ≤ r < b</p>
  <h2 style="color:red;">1.4 Revisiting Irrational Numbers (Deleted)</h2>
  <p style="color:red;">Proof that √2 is irrational: Assume √2 = p/q in lowest form → p² = 2q² → p even → p = 2k → q even → Contradiction</p>
